Reduced Vertices / Rays:
  1  1  0  0  1  1  0  0  1  1  1  1  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  1  # -> the local vertex
  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  0  0  0  0  1  0  0  0  1  1  1  1  0  2  # -> the nonlocal vertex with k=2
  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  0  0  0  0  1  0  0  0  1  1  1  0  0  3  # -> the nonlocal vertex with k=3. Is equivalent to the one presented in BLM+05, and generated by nonlocal_nss_vertex_classes_from_BLM05. I checked that using the function vertices_are_equivalent.
